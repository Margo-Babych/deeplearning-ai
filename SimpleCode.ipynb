Ungraded Lab: The Hello World of Deep Learning with Neural Networks
Like every first app, you should start with something super simple that shows the overall scaffolding for how your code works. In the case of creating neural networks, one simple case is where it learns the relationship between two numbers. So, for example, if you were writing code for a function like this, you already know the 'rules':
def hw_function(x):
y = (2 * x) - 1
return y
So how would you train a neural network to do the equivalent task? By using data! By feeding it with a set of x's and y's, it should be able to figure out the relationship between them.
This is obviously a very different paradigm from what you might be used to. So let's step through it piece by piece."""

import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow import keras

print(tf.__version__)

# Build a simple Sequential model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([keras.layers.Dense(units=1, input_shape=[1])])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Declare model inputs and outputs for training
xs = np.array([-1.0,  0.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], dtype=float)
ys = np.array([-3.0, -1.0, 1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 7.0], dtype=float)

# Train the model
model.fit(xs, ys, epochs=500)

# Make a prediction
print(model.predict([10.0]))

You might have thought 19, right? But it ended up being a little under. Why do you think that is?

Remember that neural networks deal with probabilities. So given the data that we fed the model with, it calculated that there is a very high probability that the relationship 
between x and y is y=2x-1, but with only 6 data points we can't know for sure. As a result, the result for 10 is very close to 19, but not necessarily 19.
